			Bombay Beach is a small town in the Sonoran desert of Southeast California, sitting on the banks of the Salton Sea, the biggest lake in California. The Salton Sea was accidentally formed in 1905 when the Colorado River overflowed into it via canals built to irrigate the area around the historic lakebed, following a major storm. Legend has it the town was given its name, "Bomb Bay" by the U.S. Military, who was testing weapons there before the town was built. 

			In the 1940s and 50s, Bombay Beach became a popular resort town for vacationers and retirees, a sort of French Riviera of the western U.S. But in the 70s, the Salton Sea began to suffer ecological degradation, flooding, contamination from agricultural runoff, and increasing salinity. The state stopped irrigating the area and the lake is gradually drying up, exposing the lakebed and releasing dust into the air. Millions of dead fish washed ashore, leaving behind bones and other detritus. 

			As tourism dried up, the town's population plumeted from around 1,000 in 1990 to less than 200 in 2018. Many lots were abandoned by former residents
